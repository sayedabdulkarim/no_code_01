# TODO App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ File Content Type Error
**Problem**: "The 'data' argument must be of type string or an instance of Buffer"
**Fix**: Added validation in `task-based-generator.js` to ensure file.content is always a string

### 2. ✅ Context Export Pattern
**Problem**: "Module has no exported member 'useTodoContext'"
**Fixes**:
- Added explicit Context pattern template in task-based generator
- Created `ContextPatternValidator` to validate exports
- Created `ContextPatternFixer` to automatically fix missing exports
- Integrated into quick-fix-checker for automatic fixing during build

### 3. ✅ Import/Export Validation
**Problem**: Components importing non-existent exports
**Fix**: Enhanced validation to check Context patterns specifically

### 4. ✅ Boilerplate Files
**Problem**: Missing layout.tsx causing "Internal Server Error"
**Fix**: Added boilerplate templates that are always included

## How It Works Now

1. **Generation Phase**:
   - Task-based generator has explicit Context pattern template
   - LLM is instructed to follow exact export patterns
   - File content is validated to be string

2. **Validation Phase**:
   - Import/Export validator checks all imports have exports
   - Context Pattern validator checks Context files have required exports
   - Boilerplate files are added if missing

3. **Build Phase**:
   - Quick fix checker detects Context export errors
   - Context Pattern Fixer automatically adds missing exports
   - Build validator retries after fixes

## Test Results

- ✅ Counter app: Works perfectly
- ⚠️ TODO app: Still needs real LLM testing but validation works
- ✅ Context pattern test: Passes with mocked data
- ✅ Boilerplate test: All files included

## Remaining Work

1. Test with real TODO app generation
2. Add more app pattern tests (shopping cart, forms, etc.)
3. Monitor for other edge cases
