# MCP Integration Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Claude API Integration**
- Replaced OpenRouter with direct Claude API (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`)
- Created `claude-service.js` for basic Claude API calls
- Created `claude-service-production.js` with MCP support
- Updated all services to use Claude API instead of OpenRouter

### 2. **MCP Server** (`mcp/server.js`)
Created 6 MCP tools that Claude can use:

1. **read_project_file** - Read specific files from projects
2. **list_project_files** - List files in project directories  
3. **search_code** - Search for patterns across project files
4. **check_project_structure** - Analyze project configuration
5. **run_build** - Run build commands and capture output
6. **read_error_log** - Read build/runtime errors

### 3. **MCP Client** (`services/mcp-client.js`)
- Manages communication between Claude and MCP server
- Handles tool calls with proper error handling
- Provides convenient methods for each MCP tool

### 4. **Enhanced Services**
- **claude-service-production.js**: Claude service with MCP integration
- **task-based-generator-mcp.js**: Task generator that uses MCP for better code generation
- **agent-service.js**: Updated to use production Claude service

### 5. **Updated Routes**
- `update-project-v2.js`: Now uses MCP-enhanced task generator
- Passes project name to enable MCP context during code generation

## How It Works

### Without MCP (New Projects):
```
User Request → Generate Code → Generic Code
```

### With MCP (Existing Projects):
```
User Request → Claude Analyzes Request
    ↓
Claude: "I need to see current code"
    ↓
MCP: read_project_file() → Returns actual files
    ↓
Claude: Generates compatible code
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Generation**
   - Claude sees actual project structure
   - Generated code matches existing patterns
   - Fewer integration issues

2. **Smarter Error Fixes**
   - Claude can read error context
   - Provides precise fixes
   - Understands dependencies

3. **Reduced Token Usage**
   - Only reads needed files
   - No massive context dumps
   - More efficient API usage

## Testing

### To test the integration:

1. **Start your backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend_node
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Update an existing project**:
   - Select a project in the UI
   - Enter update requirements
   - Watch the terminal for MCP tool usage

3. **Monitor MCP Activity**:
   - Look for "Claude requesting tool:" messages
   - See which files Claude reads
   - Observe how it generates compatible code

## Environment Variables

Make sure you have:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx  # Your Claude API key
```

## Cost Comparison

- **OpenRouter**: ~$3.75 per 1M tokens (with markup)
- **Claude Direct**: $3.00 per 1M tokens (no markup)
- **With MCP**: Even more efficient due to targeted file reading

## Next Steps

1. Monitor API usage in your Anthropic dashboard
2. Test with real project updates
3. Observe how MCP improves code quality
4. Consider adding more MCP tools as needed
