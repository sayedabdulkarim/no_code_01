# Stopwatch Application PRD

## 1. Overview
We need to build a simple, easy-to-use digital stopwatch that users can operate through their web browser. The application will function like a traditional stopwatch, allowing users to measure elapsed time with basic controls.

**Goal:** Create an intuitive stopwatch that helps users track time intervals with standard start, stop, and reset functionality.

## 2. Core Features

### Time Display
- Large, clear display showing elapsed time
- Format: Minutes:Seconds:Hundredths (00:00:00)
- Updates in real-time while running

### Control Buttons
- Start: Begins the timer
- Stop: Pauses the current time
- Reset: Returns the display to zero (00:00:00)

### Basic Timer Logic
- Accurate time tracking while running
- Maintains time state when stopped
- Ability to resume from stopped time
- Clear reset functionality

## 3. User Experience

### Timer Display
- Time should be prominently displayed in the center
- Numbers should be large and easy to read
- Leading zeros should be shown for consistent formatting

### Button Interactions
- Buttons should be clearly labeled and prominently placed
- Start button changes to Stop when timer is running
- Buttons should provide visual feedback when clicked
- Reset should be available at any time

### Expected User Flow
1. User sees 00:00:00 display with Start and Reset buttons
2. Clicking Start begins the timer
3. Start button transforms to Stop while running
4. Clicking Stop pauses the timer
5. Clicking Reset returns to initial state

## 4. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Timer must continue running while browser tab is active
- Timer must pause when Stop is clicked
- Reset must work in both running and stopped states
- Time display must update smoothly (no jumping numbers)

### Behavioral Rules
- Start button should be disabled while timer is running
- Stop button should be disabled when timer is not running
- Reset should be available in any state
- Timer should maintain accuracy up to hundredths of a second

### State Management
- Timer state (running/stopped) must be maintained
- Current time value must be preserved when stopped
- All data resets when Reset button is clicked
- No need to save or persist time between sessions

This document outlines a straightforward stopwatch implementation that can be built using basic React state management and standard web technologies.
