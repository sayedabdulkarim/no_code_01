# Color Picker PRD

## 1. Overview
We need to create a simple color selection tool that allows users to pick colors and see their corresponding hex codes (like #FF0000 for red). This tool will help designers, developers, and other users quickly find and reference specific colors for their projects.

The main goal is to provide an intuitive way to select colors and instantly see their hex values, making it easier to use these colors in other applications or projects.

## 2. Core Features

### Color Selection Interface
- A visual color picker that displays the full color spectrum
- Simple point-and-click or drag interface to select colors
- Real-time display of the selected color
- Clear visibility of the current selection

### Hex Code Display
- Shows the exact hex code of the selected color
- Updates immediately when a new color is selected
- Displays in standard #RRGGBB format
- Easy-to-read text format

## 3. User Experience

Users should be able to:
- See the color picker immediately upon opening the application
- Click or drag within the color picker to select a color
- See their selected color displayed prominently
- View the hex code in a clear, readable format
- Copy the hex code for use elsewhere (by selecting the text)
- Make multiple color selections without needing to refresh

The interface should be:
- Clean and uncluttered
- Responsive to user interactions
- Visible on a single screen without scrolling
- Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices

## 4. Requirements

### Display Requirements
- Color picker must be large enough to allow precise color selection
- Hex code must be displayed in a clear, legible font
- Selected color should be shown in a preview area

### Functional Requirements
- Color updates must happen in real-time as users make selections
- Hex codes must be accurately generated for each selected color
- All colors in the standard web color spectrum should be available
- Interface must work with both mouse and touch input

### Technical Constraints
- All data will be handled in component state
- No need for saving or loading colors
- No user accounts or profiles needed
- No connection to external services required

This tool should be straightforward, focused on its core purpose, and immediately usable without any setup or configuration.
