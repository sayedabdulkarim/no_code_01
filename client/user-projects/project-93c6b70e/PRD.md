# Color Picker PRD

## 1. Overview
We need to create a simple color selection tool that allows users to pick colors visually and see their corresponding hex color codes (like #FF0000 for red). This tool will help users quickly find and reference specific colors for their design needs.

The main goal is to provide an intuitive way to select colors and instantly see their hex values, making it easier for users to work with color codes in their projects.

## 2. Core Features

### Visual Color Selection
- A standard color picker interface that shows the full color spectrum
- Users can click or drag to select their desired color
- The selected color is displayed prominently

### Color Code Display
- Shows the hex code (e.g., #FF0000) of the currently selected color
- Updates immediately when a new color is selected
- Displays the code in a clear, readable format

### Preview Area
- Shows a preview swatch of the selected color
- Large enough to clearly see the chosen color
- Updates in real-time as users select different colors

## 3. User Experience

Users should be able to:
- See the color picker immediately upon opening the application
- Click or drag within the color picker to select a color
- See their selected color displayed in a preview area
- View the hex code for their selected color
- Select new colors as many times as they want
- Use the tool without any sign-in or setup

The interface should be:
- Clean and uncluttered
- Responsive to user interactions
- Visible on a single screen without scrolling
- Easy to understand without instructions

## 4. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Must display a working color picker control
- Must show accurate hex codes for selected colors
- Must update color preview and hex code instantly when selection changes
- Must work entirely in the browser with no server communication

### Constraints
- All color data stays in the current session only
- No need to save or load colors
- No color history needed
- No export or import functionality required
- Must work on modern web browsers
- Must be usable on both desktop and mobile devices

### Display Requirements
- Color picker must be large enough to select colors precisely
- Hex code must be clearly readable
- Color preview should be prominent enough to verify selection
- All elements must fit comfortably on one screen

This tool should be straightforward, focused solely on color selection and hex code display, with no additional complexity or features.
