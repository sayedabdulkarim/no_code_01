# Color Picker PRD

## 1. Overview
We need to create a simple color picker tool that allows users to select colors and view their corresponding hex codes (e.g., #FF0000 for red). This tool will help designers, developers, and other users quickly identify and copy color codes for their projects.

The main goal is to provide an intuitive way to pick colors and instantly see their hex values, all within a single, easy-to-use interface.

## 2. Core Features

### Color Selection
- A visual color picker that displays the full color spectrum
- Ability to click or drag to select any color
- Real-time display of the selected color
- Simple preset colors for quick selection of common options

### Color Code Display
- Clear display of the selected color's hex code
- Easy-to-read format with the # prefix
- Option to copy the hex code with a single click

## 3. User Experience

Users should be able to:
- See the color picker immediately upon loading the page
- Click anywhere in the color spectrum to select a color
- View their selected color in a preview area
- See the hex code update instantly as they select different colors
- Click a button to copy the hex code to their clipboard
- Select from basic preset colors (red, blue, green, etc.) via simple buttons
- Receive visual feedback when copying the hex code

## 4. Requirements

### Display Requirements
- The color picker should be prominently displayed
- The hex code should be shown in a clear, readable font
- The selected color should be displayed in a preview box
- All text should be visible regardless of the selected color

### Functional Requirements
- Color selection must update in real-time
- Hex codes must always be displayed in the correct format (#XXXXXX)
- Copy functionality must use the system clipboard
- The interface must work on both desktop and mobile browsers
- The tool must function entirely in the browser with no server requirements

### Behavioral Requirements
- Color changes should happen immediately with no delay
- The hex code should update as soon as a new color is selected
- The copy button should provide visual feedback when clicked
- The interface should remain responsive and smooth during color selection

This tool should be straightforward, fast, and reliable, focusing on the essential task of color selection and hex code display.
