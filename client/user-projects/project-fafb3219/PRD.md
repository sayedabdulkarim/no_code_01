# Counter Application PRD

## 1. Overview
We need to build a straightforward counter application that allows users to increase or decrease a number value using simple buttons. This basic tool will help users keep track of numerical counts for any purpose they choose.

Main Goal: Create an intuitive, easy-to-use counter that responds immediately to user input and displays the current count clearly.

## 2. Core Features
- **Number Display**
  - A clear, visible display of the current count number
  - Starting value set to zero
  - Whole numbers only (no decimals)

- **Control Buttons**
  - An increment (+) button to increase the count
  - A decrement (-) button to decrease the count
  - Each button press changes the count by exactly one

## 3. User Experience
Users should be able to:
- See the counter value prominently displayed in the center
- Press the increment button to add one to the count
- Press the decrement button to subtract one from the count
- View changes to the count immediately after pressing a button
- Use the counter repeatedly without refreshing
- Access all functions without scrolling or navigating menus

## 4. Requirements
Functional Requirements:
- Counter must start at zero when the application loads
- Counter can go into negative numbers
- No upper or lower limits on the counter value
- Buttons must be large enough to click easily
- Count display must be clearly readable
- Changes must happen instantly when buttons are clicked

Visual Requirements:
- Clean, minimal interface
- Adequate spacing between buttons
- Clear visual distinction between buttons
- Numbers should be easily readable at arm's length
- High contrast colors for better visibility

This document outlines a focused, achievable scope for a simple counter application that meets the specified technical constraints while delivering a useful tool for users.
