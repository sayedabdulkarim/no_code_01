# Color Picker PRD

## 1. Overview
We need to build a simple color picker tool that allows users to select colors and displays their corresponding hex codes (like #FF0000 for red). This tool will help designers, developers, and other users quickly find and copy color codes for their projects.

The main goal is to provide an intuitive way to pick colors and immediately see their hex values, all within a single, easy-to-use interface.

## 2. Core Features

1. Color Selection Interface
   - A visual color picker that lets users select any color
   - Shows the full color spectrum in an easy-to-navigate format
   - Updates in real-time as users move through different colors

2. Hex Code Display
   - Clearly shows the hex code of the currently selected color
   - Updates automatically when a new color is picked
   - Displays in standard 6-character format (#RRGGBB)

3. Preview Area
   - Shows a sample/preview of the currently selected color
   - Large enough to clearly see the chosen color
   - Updates instantly with color selection

## 3. User Experience

Users should be able to:
- Click and drag within the color picker area to select colors
- See the color preview update immediately as they move
- View the hex code clearly displayed below or beside the picker
- Click the hex code to copy it to their clipboard
- Select colors using either:
  * Click and drag in the main color area
  * Adjust individual color sliders if provided
  * Enter a hex code directly (optional)
